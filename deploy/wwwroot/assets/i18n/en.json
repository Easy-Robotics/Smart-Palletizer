  "HELP_CONTEXT": {
    "MAX_PRODUCT_NUMBER": "The pattern generator creates a point list with the maximum possible number of products. The maximum product number depends on the product / pallet dimensions and generator settings.",
    "PALLET_EDGE": "Product Gaps define the minimum distance between the product edges on the pallet.",
    "PRODUCT_DROPPING_HEIGHT": "Offsets to the place position which will be added to the product height. It defines the distance of the product bottom to the lower layer at the place point. The offset height should be used to prevent pushing the product on the pallet or against the lower placed product.",
    "ADD_OFFSET": "Defines the frame to the pallet origin. This setting is not required. If a object coordinate system is used for the pallet. Use this setting if the points are used in the world coordinate system (WCS).",
    "PRODUCT_GAPS": "The edge distance defines the distance from the products to the edges of the pallet. A positive edge distance defines, that the products need to be placed at least with the defined distance to the pallet edge. The area of the pallet is reduced. A negative edge distance defines an overhang of the products over the pallet edges. The area of the pallet is enlarged.",
    "INTERLAYER_DIMENSION": "You can define a height for interlayer between the product layers. 0: no interlayer, >0: interlayer between products in z-direction, <0: products are stackable one inside another. The resulting height of the wto products is lower than two product heights. Define the height reduction.",
    "INTERLAYER_OFFSET": "The interlayer frame defines the offset from the center of the pallet to the place position of the interlayer.",
    "PATTERN_MODE": "A block consists of products with the same orientation. One-block: all products have one orientation. Two-block: products are placed in two orientations (90° and 0°). Three-block: like Two-block, but could fill a gap with an additional block. Four/Five-block: up to four or five blocks on the pallet. Most products: the mode with the most products on the pallet. ",
    "LAYER_MIRRORING": "Tower stacking: all layers have the same pattern. MirroringL products will be mirrored on the x- or y-side of the pallet for the even layers(2,4,6,...). Hint: Mirroring needs pattern allignment center of pallet and rectangle pattern.",
    "PATTERN_ALIGNMENT": "Origin of pallet: all products are placed from the origin of the pallet. Center of pallet: all products are centered on the pallet (recommended). Keep gaps: gaps cannot be enlarged and will be kept like configured. Rectangle pattern: the product gaps are enlarged to create a rectangle pattern. ",
    "START_PLACE_IN": "The place order defines the index of the point in the point list, defines X first or Y first priority.",
    "PLACE_ORDER": "Ascending: place products with smaller position at first. Descending: place products with higher position at first. Example: X first, X ascending, Y descending: the first product is the product with the lowest x-position. If there are more than one product with this x-position use the product with the largest y-position. "
